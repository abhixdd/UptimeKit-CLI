# Changesets

Hello! This folder contains changeset files that track what's changing in the next release.

## Adding a changeset

When you make changes, run:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Then:
- Pick patch/minor/major
- Describe what changed

That's it! Commit the generated file with your PR.

**Note:** Docs, tests, or typo fixes? Skip the changeset - not needed!
